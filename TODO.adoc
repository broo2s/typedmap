* Measure the performance impact of `ITypedKey.keyType` and `ITypedKey.valueType`.
  ** We don't really use these properties for most cases - they could be useful for more specific needs.
  ** They require using reflection whenever we use `typedKey()` or initialize a key with data.
  ** It could be optimized with global cache if needed.
* Advanced typed map implementations:
  ** Polymorphic.
  ** Map returning nulls for missing nullable items.
  ** Map that creates values on demand with value providers/factories.
** Factory for creating a typed map for specific needs, with required features.
* Java interop.
